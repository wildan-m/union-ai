# Flyte ML Pipeline Demo - Union.ai Interview Project

This project demonstrates key concepts for the Customer Success Engineer role at Union.ai, showcasing:

- **ML workflow orchestration** with Flyte
- **Common customer scenarios** and debugging approaches  
- **Error handling patterns** and troubleshooting guides
- **Resource management** and optimization strategies

## 🎯 Interview Focus Areas

This demo covers the main responsibilities from the job description:

### 1. Customer Issue Resolution
- **File**: `workflows/debugging_scenarios.py`
- Demonstrates common failure modes: memory issues, timeouts, data validation errors
- Shows how to diagnose platform vs. user code problems
- Includes detailed error messages with resolution guidance

### 2. Technical Knowledge Areas
- **Python/ML expertise**: Complete scikit-learn pipeline with proper error handling
- **Infrastructure understanding**: Resource allocation, containerization, distributed processing
- **Customer support patterns**: Clear documentation, troubleshooting guides, FAQ-style solutions

### 3. Product Documentation  
- **File**: `docs/troubleshooting-guide.md`
- Customer-facing troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
- Template responses for customer communications
- Best practices and preventive measures

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic ML pipeline
python workflows/ml_pipeline.py

# Test debugging scenarios
python workflows/debugging_scenarios.py

# Build container (for production deployment)
docker build -t flyte-ml-demo .
```

## 🛠 Key Technical Demonstrations

### ML Pipeline (`workflows/ml_pipeline.py`)
- **Data validation**: Schema checking, type validation, null handling
- **Resource management**: CPU/memory allocation, resource optimization
- **Model lifecycle**: Training, evaluation, persistence, batch inference
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with customer-friendly messages

### Debugging Scenarios (`workflows/debugging_scenarios.py`)
- **Memory exhaustion**: Resource constraint simulation and handling
- **Timeout issues**: Long-running process management
- **Data problems**: File path, encoding, schema validation errors
- **Dependency conflicts**: Version checking and compatibility issues
- **External services**: API failures, rate limiting, authentication errors

### Customer Support Materials (`docs/troubleshooting-guide.md`)
- **Common issues**: Workflow execution, data processing, model training problems
- **Debugging commands**: Essential Flyte CLI and kubectl commands
- **Communication templates**: Ready-to-use customer response examples
- **Best practices**: Preventive measures and optimization strategies

## 🎤 Interview Discussion Points

### Customer Success Engineering Focus

1. **Issue Diagnosis**: How to differentiate between platform issues and user code problems
2. **Customer Communication**: Translating technical errors into actionable guidance
3. **Escalation Criteria**: When to involve Engineering vs. resolving directly
4. **Documentation Strategy**: Creating self-service resources to reduce support load

### Technical Expertise Areas

1. **Distributed Systems**: Understanding resource allocation, scaling, fault tolerance
2. **ML Infrastructure**: Model lifecycle management, data pipeline optimization
3. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes knowledge for debugging cluster issues
4. **Performance Tuning**: Resource optimization and bottleneck identification

### Union.ai/Flyte Specific Knowledge

1. **Workflow Patterns**: Common customer use cases and implementation approaches
2. **Integration Challenges**: Connecting Flyte with customer existing infrastructure
3. **Enterprise Requirements**: Security, compliance, scalability considerations
4. **Community Engagement**: Contributing to open-source and supporting community users

## 💡 Customer Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Enterprise Customer - Resource Optimization
*Customer*: "Our ML training workflows are running slowly and costing too much."

*Approach*:
1. Analyze current resource allocation patterns
2. Profile memory/CPU usage during execution  
3. Recommend resource optimization strategies
4. Implement cost monitoring and alerts

### Scenario 2: SMB Customer - Getting Started
*Customer*: "New to Flyte, workflows failing with confusing errors."

*Approach*:
1. Review workflow code for common anti-patterns
2. Validate environment setup and dependencies
3. Provide step-by-step debugging guidance
4. Share relevant documentation and examples

### Scenario 3: Technical Escalation
*Customer*: "Workflows work locally but fail in production cluster."

*Approach*:
1. Compare local vs. production configurations
2. Check cluster resources and networking
3. Collaborate with Engineering on platform-specific issues
4. Document resolution for future similar cases
